# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

my first introduction into machine learning as part of my internship at the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

## Thanks

special thanks to Dr. Heng_Chieh Chien for guiding me through machine learning/deep learning and introducing me to such an interesting topic. 

## The Project

the purpose of this project was to get a hands on lesson of working with training neural networks in python. I was giving a data set about microchip properties to use as the training data for the CNN. With this data I was set to create a simple py script that trained a Neural Network Model on this data and output the accuracy of said model.
